3,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3,3,Time of occurence of janaba unknown.," Praise be to Allah.If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and he had performed several prayers (salaat) not knowing, he has to perform major ablution (ghusl) and repeat the salaat from the most recent sleep in which he was wearing this clothes. However, if he finds out that the janaba was from a previous sleep, then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred1. The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba in preparation for salaat are many, one of which is Allah's command in the Qur'an, a translated meaning of which is: ""O' You who believe, do not get approach salaat while you are drunk until you know what you are saying, nor while impure due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform ghusl"" (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said ""I was a man with frequent urethral discharge, so I kept performing ghusl until the skin of my back started cracking, so I mentioned this to the Prophet peace be upon him (or it was mentioned to him) so the messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, ""Don't do ghusl if you see urethral discharge, just wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat. If semen appears, then perform ghusl""2. This hadith indicates that appearance of semen requires ghusl whereas urethral discharge only needs washing of the sexual organ followed by wudu'.From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situtations...? 1 Al-Mughni ma'a al-Sharh il-Kabeer 1/199. 2 Narrated by Abu Dawood number 206 and verified sahih by Albani in Arwaa' al-Ghaleel number 125.

4,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4,4,Junob and cannot perform ghusl or tayammum," Praise be to Allah.If we assume that he can not make ghusl on the airplane, then this is a case known to scholars of fiqh as the case of the one faqid al-tahoorain ""missing the two purifications"" (i.e. water for wudu' and soil for tayammum), and their sayings in this matter differ. Imam Ahmad and the majority of narrators say that the person should pray in his impurity, since this is what is within his capability and ability, and that Allah does not burden a soul more than it can bear. The evidence in this situation is what Imam Muslim narrated in his authentic collection of hadith that the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent some people to search for a necklace that Aa'isha had lost, during which the time for prayer had entered, so they prayed without wudu' (due to the absence of water). Afterwards they went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and mentioned this situation to him. The verse allowing tayammum was then revealed.1 The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not disapprove their action and did not command them to repeat the prayer. A similar situation can happen to patients that cannot move their limbs completely (a paralyzed person who has no one to assist him) or prisoners in some cases of being tied-up or hung-up. The intention is one's prayer should performed and not delayed from its prescribed time depending on his situation and one is not required to repeat it. This is the most appropriate, as Allah did not burden us with religion. From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations... ? 1 Sahih Muslim 367 ",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5,5,Does a woman who miscarries and discharges blood pray," Praise be to Allah.This case depends on the type of blood. Is the blood what is known as child-birth bleeding nifas or vaginal bleeding istihada (but not part of her regular period)? The scholars have declared the regulation in this matter. They said: ""If she sees the blood after the abortion of a formed human being, then it is nifas; if she sees blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas.""1 In the latter case, she is considered to be mustahada so she performs wudu' for every salaat when the time for it is due and she prays. Whereas if the aborted object is a fetus or has human-formed organs like an arm or a leg or a head, then it is considered nifas. For the case where the aborted object is disposed of in the hospital before the woman saw it, the scholars have mentioned that the least amount of time human form starts to take place is eighty one days after pregnancy.2 This is based on what came in Abdullah Bin Masoud's hadith (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said the Prophet (peace be upon him) spoke to us, and he is the truthful and believed one, and said: ""Each one of you, human creation, forms in his mother's womb forty days, then he is a hanging clot for the same amount of time, then he is a mudgha (the size of a morsel) for the same amount of time, then Allah sends an Angel who is commanded with four things: he is told to write his deeds, his livelihood and sustenance, whether he is happy or distressed ""3 Ladies in this case should spend the effort to find out from the doctors' estimations until her situation is clear to her. As for the blood that is discharged just prior to a normal delivery, if it is accompanied with the pains of contraction then it is nifas, and if not, then it is not. Sheikh ul-Islam Ibn Taimiyya, may the mercy of Allah be upon him, said: ""What she sees when the contractions commence is nifas. What is referred to here is contractions after which follows delivery; otherwise it is not nifas.""4 From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations... ? 1 al-Mughni ma' al-Sharh il-Kabeer 1/3612 Majmooa Fatawi ibn Uthaimeen 4/292 Dar al-Qutni printing.3 Sahih al-Buhari 6/303, Dar al-Fikr printing 4 Majmooa Fatawi Ibn Uthaimeen 4/327, Dar al-Fikr printing.

6,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6,6,Distraction during salaat (prayer) by shaitan," Praise be to Allah.This happened to one of the companions of the prophet (sahabah) whose name is Uthman Bin Abi Al-Aas, (may Allah be pleased with him), so he came complaining to the Prophet (peace be upon him), and he said: ""The Shaitan comes between me and my salat and causes me problems with my recitation."" So the Messenger of Allah, (peace be upon him), said: ""That is a shaitan called Khanzab, so if you feel his presence, seek refuge in Allah and blow a mist to your left three times."" He said: ""I applied this advice and Allah has rid me off him.""1 This hadith includes two ways to get rid off the shaitan of salat. The first is asking refuge in Allah from the shaitan's evil by pronouncing the words of seeking refuge and this is OK in this case. And the second: blowing with mist to the left three times. This is basically blowing air in a similar manner to spitting, but with a minute mist of saliva, on the condition that this does not disturb or bother the person next to him, nor make the masjid dirty.
